# ml1_finalproject
Final Project from Machine Learning I @ UChicago Master's in Applied Data Science. The goal of this project is to use HR data to predict employee attrition and implement retention strategies. We utilised k-prototypes clustering, tree models, logistic regression, and cluster-wise regression to identify at-risk groups of employees.
